|Styles and themes system for TaskStep|
+-------------------------------------+

The new styles and themes system lets you customize the look of TaskStep a little more easily.

In the settings section there is now an option to change the style - just add a css file to this directory for it to appear on the list.
To create your own, just customize the default one and put a copy in here, and then select it.
Place images for the style in a subdirectory of the images folder here.
Note that the subdirectory contains copies of all the default icons so that the stylesheets can access them easily.

If you want to release your style, just post in the developer forums (http://taskstep.com/forum/)
Please prefix any release posts with [Style]
